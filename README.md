# Rose Schedule Lookup Scripts
Some utility scripts to parse data from Rose's Schedule Lookup into python objects.

To use any of these scripts you simply call the script's run method with a valid Rose-Hulman Kerberous Username and Password, along with any other needed information. i.e you will need to pass in a termcode for any of the parsers. An example term code would be: 201520, which stands for the 2014-2015 Winter Quarter.
